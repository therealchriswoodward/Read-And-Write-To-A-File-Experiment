# Contains lists of files and directories ignored by GIT

# REVIEW: I added some common directories to ignore
#   as well as removed the bin and obj directories.
#   Note: The files still exists in the history and will
#   continue to take up space but at least it won't be
#   more of them.

# .vs directory contains caches used by Visual Studio
# You might want to add other IDE cache folders as well
.vs/
# bin directory contains the executable from the build step
bin/
# bin directory contains intermediate binary files the build step
obj/
